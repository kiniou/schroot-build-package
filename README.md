## üë®‚Äçüíª Hacking

If you want to hack this code and/or contribute with PR (‚ù§), you can just fork
this repository and use editable pip mode installation within a virtualenv:
1. Create your python3 virtualenv:
```shell
$ python -m virtualenv -p $(which python3) .venv
```

2. Activate your fresh virtualenv:
```shell
$ . .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the project in editable mode:
```shell
(.venv) $ pip install -e .
```

Note that if you change some requirements, you'll need to update your virtualenv install as well:
```shell
pip install -U -e .
```

üí° If you need more dev tools (eg. ipython), extra packages can be installed with:
```shell
pip install -e ".[dev,testing]"
```
